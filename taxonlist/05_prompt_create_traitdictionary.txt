You are an expert biodiversity data scientist and botanist assisting with a master thesis on enhancing Species Distribution Models (SDMs) with landscape metrics. 

I am providing a CSV file containing unique trait observations extracted from the TRY plant trait database. The columns are `TraitID`, `TraitName`, and `OrigValueStr`. 

Your task is to semantically harmonize the `OrigValueStr` descriptions into standardized ecological categories and output a new column called `Clean_Category`. 

Follow these strict rules:
1. Standardize Dispersal (e.g., TraitID 28): Map values to standard botanical terms ("Anemochory", "Zoochory", "Barochory", "Hydrochory").
2. Standardize Ordinal Timeframes (e.g., TraitID 138 Seed bank longevity): Map textual durations to standardized classes: "Transient" (< 1 yr), "Short-term persistent" (1-5 yrs), or "Long-term persistent" (> 5 yrs).
3. Exclude Noise: If `OrigValueStr` contains methodological notes, uncertainty remarks, or pure numeric measurements that shouldn't be categorized, output "Exclude" in the `Clean_Category`.
4. Formatting: Output the result strictly as a raw CSV text block containing the original columns plus the new `Clean_Category` column. Do not use markdown tables.
